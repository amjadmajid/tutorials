An external variable is one whose value can be accessed and changed by another 
module.  Inside the module that wants to access the external variable, the 
variable is declared in the normal fashion and the keyword extern is placed 
before the declaration.

An external variable has to be defined in some place among your source files.
This is done in one of two ways: 
without the keyword extern, as follows,
	int moveNumber;
Here, an initial value can be optionally assigned to the variable. 
with the keyword extern, as follows,
	extern int moveNumber = 0;
Here, an initial value must be assigned. 
Note that, these two ways are mutually exclusive.

When declaring an external array, it is not necessary to give its size.
For exmple, 
extern char text[];
If the external array is multidimensional, all but the first dimension must 
be specified. Thus, the declaration
extern char text[][81];
